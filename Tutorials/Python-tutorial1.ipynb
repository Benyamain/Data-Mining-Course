Python is an interpreted language, unlike other high-level programming languages such as C or C++. You only need to submit your Python program to an interpreter for execution, without having to explicitly compile and link the code first. The Python interpreter runs a program by executing one statement at a time.\n","\n","2. Python is a dynamically typed language, which means variable names are bound to their respective types during execution time. You do not have to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it in the code unlike Java, C++, and other statically-typed languages.\n","\n","3. Python uses the hash character ('#') to precede single-line comments. Comments represent notes of explanation within a program. Python interpreter ignores comments.\n","\n","4. You may access the variables or functions defined in another Python program file using the `import` command. This is analogous to the `import` command in Java or the `#include` command in C or C++."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vU0Ngs_4AkLX"},"source":["## 1.1 Elementary Data Types\n","\n","We first start with some definitions.\n","* <b>Variable</b>: name that represents a value stored in the computer memory.
